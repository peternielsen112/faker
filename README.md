# Python Web Activity Faker
A simple Python tool to fake web activity using the os, random, and time modules. Verified to work on macOS 15; Windows is probably fine too.

### To Use:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/peternielsen112/faker`
2. Run main.py: `python3 main.py`
3. Follow the instructions to manipulate the time range in seconds of random delays.

### Features:
- Passive anti-repeat feature
- Customizable list of web links to open (edit the file in a code editor)
- Active inspection of time range entries to prevent breakage of spacetime
